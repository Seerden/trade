The goal is to populate our database with daily OHLCV data going back ten years.

Work through the following process:

1. get a list of tickers (NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX)
    - note: can get them in CSV format from https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/screener
    - note: list of tickers should be accurate at the time of fetching, since if we ever wish to add a new ticker, we want to be able to run the routine for that ticker also

For each ticker:

-   note: consider only getting information for a subset of tickers on this initial setup run, and for any tickers that aren't included, defer fetching the data until it is requested somewhere (by us, server-side, or by a user, client-side)

2. create `${ticker}_1d` table if doesn't exist yet
3. fetch 10-year daily data from yf API
    - if failed, mark as failed somewhere (redis?) so we can retry later
4. transform raw data to rows for table
5. insert rows into table
6. mark ticker as fetched successfully somewhere (redis?)
