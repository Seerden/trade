To run the server, database and redis store, run:

```sh
docker-compose --file ./docker-compose{.dev}.yml up --force-recreate --remove-orphans --build server database api-database store
```

## `node_modules`

Note that node_modules requires a volume to be present (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38425996/docker-compose-volume-on-node-modules-but-is-empty). Currently, just run npm install manually in `/`, `/client` and `/server`

## Database init

-   Note that initdb.d scripts are only run if the data directory is empty. If we make changes to initialization (which we will, since we're very early in development), make sure to remove the pg-date folder first.
