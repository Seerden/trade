To run the server, database and redis store, run:

```sh
docker-compose up -f docker-compose(.dev).yml --force-recreate --remove-orphans --build server database
```

## Database init

-   Note that initdb.d scripts are only run if the data directory is empty. If we make changes to initialization (which we will, since we're very early in development), make sure to remove the pg-date folder first.
