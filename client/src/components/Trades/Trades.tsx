      a trade card contains the following:
      
      - duration
      - realized gain
      - unrealized gain (is only really a thing if we have access to a live data
      source)
      - fees
      - average entry price
      - average exit price
      - open quantity
      - total quantity
      - ticker (with link to /ticker/:ticker page if not already on that page?)

      - the design of this component may depend on what options we allow for
        sorting
         - are trades always sorted by ticker? day? type (long/short)?
