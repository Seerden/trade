Navigation: tree-like navigation bar (sidebar, header, footer, ... - there's a lot of options here. Maybe make it configurable).

Build the tree from

```typescript
type Link = {
    label: string,
    to: string,
    children: Array<Link>
}


Array<{
    label: string,
    to: string
    children: Array<>
}>
```
