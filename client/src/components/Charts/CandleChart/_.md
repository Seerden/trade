Consider for now only a chart without drawings or indicators.

every candle has open, high, low, close, volume (OHLCV)

### Smallest candle width:

- each candle should be visible, so the minimum width per candle is 1 pixel.
  - for 1-pixel wide candles, how do we distinguish between candle body and
    wick? Color. Color's the only thing we can do. Make the body green/red (or
    customizable), and the wicks black (again, could be made customizable).
- displayed price range should be based on two things
  - visually appealing scale. Endpoints should probably be at whole cents or
    dollars, depending on the stock price.

We don't chart in realtime for the time being, only in hindsight (completed
sessions). So there's not much variance in the amount of candles in the
displayed time range.

### Testing visual clarity:

One trading session (without premarket) goes from 9:30 to 16:00, so 6:30 => 390
minutes = 390 bars with 1-minute granularity. Say a candle's 5px wide, with 2px
gap between candles. Means a chart needs 5*390 + 2*(390+1) = 2732 px per chart.
