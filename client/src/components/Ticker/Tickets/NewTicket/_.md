NewTicket fields as they should be presented to the backend:

```
{
    action
    ticker
    price
    quantity
    timestamp
}
```

In the form, we have a separate field for `date` and `time`, which we then convert to market-hours timestamp (on the backend).

---

Implementation todo:

-   [ ] give useNewTicket an argument like defaultTicket = {}, and initialize ticket state based off this. That allows us to pre-load various fields in the form (for example, on a /ticker/MSFT page, we coudl always pre-fill the tickets with `{ticker: MSFT}`)
